**Subject:** Withdrawing My Acceptance – Grateful for the Opportunity  

Dear Mr. Tom,  

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to formally withdraw my acceptance of the job offer at [Company Name]. This was not an easy decision, but after careful reflection, I’ve decided to pursue a position as a research assistant at [Local University] to further my long-term goal of earning a PhD.  

I sincerely appreciate the time, effort, and trust you and the team extended to me throughout the hiring process. The opportunity to join your company was truly valuable, and I’m deeply grateful for the chance to have been considered. I regret any inconvenience this change may cause and want to express my utmost respect for your organization.  

Thank you again for your understanding and support. I hope our paths cross again in the future, and I wish you and the team continued success.  

Best regards,  
[Your Full Name]  
[Your Contact Information, if appropriate]

### Key Features:  
- **Gratitude-focused**: Repeated thanks and acknowledgment of the opportunity soften the withdrawal.  
- **Concise ownership of the decision**: Clearly states the reason (academic pursuit) without over-explaining.  
- **Professional closure**: Leaves the door open for future interactions while maintaining boundaries ("get far away").  
- **Neutral-positive tone**: Avoids excessive apology (which might imply guilt) but shows regret for practical impacts.  

Let me know if you'd like to adjust the tone or details further!
