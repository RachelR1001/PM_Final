**Subject:** Update on My Job Acceptance – With Deep Gratitude  

Dear Mr. Tom,  

I hope this email finds you well. First and foremost, I want to express my sincere gratitude for the opportunity to join [Company Name] and for the time and effort you and your team have invested in me. It was an honor to receive your offer, and I truly appreciated the chance to learn more about your organization’s impactful work.  

After much reflection, however, I’ve made the difficult decision to pursue a role as a research assistant at [Local University] to further my academic goals, including eventually earning a PhD. This path aligns closely with my long-term aspirations, though it was not an easy choice given my respect for your team and the exciting opportunity you extended.  

I deeply regret any inconvenience this may cause and want to thank you again for your kindness and understanding. I’m truly grateful for the support you’ve shown me throughout this process, and I hope we might cross paths professionally in the future. Please let me know if there’s anything I can do to assist with the transition.  

Wishing you and [Company Name] continued success, and I hope to stay in touch.  

With warm regards,  
[Your Full Name]  
[Your Contact Information]

### Key Tone Adjustments:  
- **Gratitude-first approach**: Opens and closes with appreciation to soften the news.  
- **Hierarchy-aware**: Uses respectful language ("Mr. Tom," "deeply regret," "thank you again") to acknowledge the receiver’s higher status.  
- **Mitigates negative consequences**:  
  - Explicitly acknowledges the inconvenience (shows accountability).  
  - Leaves the door open for future collaboration ("hope to stay in touch").  
  - Offers assistance (subtle gesture to maintain goodwill).  
- **Concise but personal**: Balances professionalism with warmth to avoid sounding cold or transactional.  

Let me know if you'd like to tweak any phrasing!
