**Subject:** Update on My Decision Regarding the Job Offer  

Dear Mr. Tom,  

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to sincerely thank you for the opportunity to join [Company Name] and for the trust you’ve placed in me by extending the job offer. After much reflection, however, I’ve decided to pursue a path more closely aligned with my long-term academic goals—specifically, a research assistant position at a local university with the aim of eventually pursuing a PhD.  

This was not an easy decision, as I deeply appreciate the value of the role and the team. I am truly grateful for the time and effort you and your colleagues invested in me throughout the hiring process. Please know that my decision stems from a desire to follow my passion for research, and it is no reflection on the incredible opportunity your company provided.  

I regret any inconvenience this may cause and want to express my utmost respect for your organization. Thank you again for your understanding and support. I hope our paths may cross again in the future.  

Warm regards,  
[Your Full Name]

**Key Tone Adjustments:**  
- **Gratitude-first approach** ("sincerely thank," "deeply appreciate," "truly grateful") to soften the decline.  
- **Clear but respectful rationale** to avoid ambiguity while emphasizing your academic commitment.  
- **Neutral-to-positive closure** to leave the door open professionally without overpromising future ties (aligning with "get far away" but not burning bridges).  

Let me know if you'd like any refinements!
