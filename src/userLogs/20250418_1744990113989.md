**Subject:** Withdrawing My Acceptance of the Job Offer  

Dear Mr. Tom,  

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to formally inform you that, after careful consideration, I have decided to withdraw my acceptance of the job offer at [Company Name]. This was not an easy decision, but I have chosen to pursue a role as a research assistant at a local university to further my academic goals, including eventually earning a PhD.  

I am deeply grateful for the opportunity you and the team extended to me, and I sincerely appreciate the time and effort invested in my candidacy. It was a privilege to be considered for the position, and I regret any inconvenience this change may cause.  

Thank you again for your understanding and support. I truly value the experience and hope our paths may cross again in the future.  

Wishing you and the team continued success.  

Best regards,  
[Your Full Name]  
[Your Contact Information, if needed]

### Key Notes:  
- **Gratitude-focused**: Repeated thanks and acknowledgment of the opportunity soften the message.  
- **Clarity**: Directly states the decision and reason without over-explaining.  
- **Professionalism**: Neutral yet warm closing maintains goodwill without implying future ties (aligns with "get far away").  
- **Avoids harshness**: No defensive language; frames the decision as a personal pivot rather than a rejection of the offer.  

Let me know if you'd like any adjustments!
