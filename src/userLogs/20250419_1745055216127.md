**Subject:** Withdrawing My Acceptance – Grateful for the Opportunity  

Dear Mr. Tom,  

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to formally withdraw my acceptance of the job offer at [Company Name]. This was not an easy decision, but after careful reflection, I have decided to pursue a role as a research assistant at [Local University] to further my goal of earning a PhD in the future.  

I am deeply grateful for the opportunity you and the team extended to me, and I sincerely appreciate the time and effort invested in my candidacy. Your support and trust have meant a great deal to me, and I regret any inconvenience this change may cause.  

Thank you again for your understanding and for the chance to be part of your organization, even if briefly. I wish you and the team continued success, and I hope our paths may cross again in the future.  

Best regards,  
[Your Full Name]  
[Your Contact Information, if needed]

### Key Tone Adjustments:  
1. **Gratitude First**: Opens and closes with appreciation to soften the decline.  
2. **Neutral Distance**: Acknowledges the relationship without overpromising future ties ("hope our paths may cross").  
3. **Avoids Harshness**: Uses phrases like "careful reflection" and "regret any inconvenience" to convey respect.  
4. **Conciseness**: Medium length—enough to be thoughtful but not overly verbose.  

Let me know if you'd like to tweak any sections!
