**Subject:** Withdrawing My Acceptance of the Job Offer  

Dear Mr. Tom,  

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to formally withdraw my acceptance of the job offer at [Company Name]. This was not an easy decision, but after careful reflection, I’ve realized that my true passion lies in academia, and I’ve decided to pursue a role as a research assistant at [Local University] with the goal of eventually earning a PhD.  

I am deeply grateful for the opportunity you extended to me and for the time and effort you and your team invested in the hiring process. I sincerely appreciate your trust and the kindness shown throughout our interactions.  

I regret any inconvenience this may cause and want to express my utmost respect for your organization. I hope you understand that this decision aligns with my long-term aspirations, and I’m truly thankful for your support.  

Thank you again for the incredible opportunity, and I wish you and the team continued success.

### Key Tone Adjustments:  
- **Gratitude/Appreciation**: Repeated thanks and acknowledgment of the opportunity.  
- **Avoiding Harshness**: Softened phrasing (e.g., "not an easy decision," "true passion lies in academia").  
- **Neutral Relationship Maintenance**: Professional and polite, without overpromising future ties (aligns with "get far away").  

Let me know if you'd like any refinements!
