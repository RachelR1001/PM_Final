**Subject:** Withdrawing My Acceptance of the Job Offer  

Dear Mr. Tom,  

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to sincerely thank you for the opportunity to join [Company Name] and for the time and effort you and your team have invested in my candidacy. After careful reflection, I’ve made the difficult decision to withdraw my acceptance of the job offer.  

This was not an easy choice, but I’ve decided to pursue a role as a research assistant at [Local University] to further my academic goals, including eventually earning a PhD. This path aligns closely with my long-term aspirations in research, and I feel compelled to follow this direction at this time.  

I deeply appreciate your understanding and kindness throughout the hiring process, and I regret any inconvenience my change of plans may cause. I have great respect for your company and the work you do, and I’m truly grateful for the chance to have connected with you.  

Thank you again for your support and consideration. I wish you and the team continued success, and I hope our paths may cross again in the future.  

Warm regards,  
[Your Full Name]

### Key Features:  
1. **Gratitude-Centric**: Repeated thanks and acknowledgment of the opportunity soften the message.  
2. **Clarity with Tact**: Directly states the withdrawal but frames it as a thoughtful, non-reversible decision.  
3. **Future-Oriented**: Emphasizes academic goals (not comparing/denigrating the company’s offer).  
4. **Relationship-Neutral**: Leaves the door open professionally without overpromising future ties ("hope our paths may cross").  

Let me know if you'd like any adjustments!
