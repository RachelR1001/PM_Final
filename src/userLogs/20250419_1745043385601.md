**Subject:** Update on My Decision Regarding the Job Offer  

Dear Mr. Tom,  

I hope this email finds you well. I’m writing to share an update regarding the job offer I previously accepted from your company. After careful reflection, I’ve decided to pursue a role as a research assistant at a local university to further my academic goals, including eventually earning a PhD.  

While I’m deeply grateful for the opportunity to join your team and truly appreciate the trust and support you’ve extended, this path aligns more closely with my long-term aspirations. This wasn’t an easy decision, but I believe it’s the right step for my personal and professional growth.  

I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and want to thank you again for your kindness and understanding throughout the process. I’ve learned a great deal from our interactions and hold your organization in high regard.  

Thank you for your time and consideration, and I hope we can stay in touch.  

Warm regards,  
[Your Full Name]

### Key Tone Adjustments:  
- **Gratitude-first**: Opens and closes with appreciation to soften the declination.  
- **Neutral but warm**: Avoids over-apologizing (which can sound insincere) while acknowledging the impact.  
- **Forward-looking**: Focuses on your future goals rather than dwelling on the rejection.  
- **Professional yet personal**: Balances formality with sincerity to maintain respect without fostering distance.  

Let me know if you'd like to tweak any phrasing!
