**Subject:** Update on Job Offer Acceptance  

Dear Mr. Tom,  

I hope this email finds you well. First and foremost, I want to express my deepest gratitude for the opportunity to join your team and for the trust you’ve placed in me. I sincerely appreciate the time and effort you and your colleagues have invested in the hiring process.  

After careful reflection, I’ve made the difficult decision to pursue a role as a research assistant at a local university to further prepare for a PhD program. While I was initially enthusiastic about the position at your company, I’ve come to realize that my long-term goals are firmly rooted in academia, and this path aligns more closely with those aspirations.  

I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and want to emphasize how much I value the offer and the kindness you’ve shown me throughout this process. I’m truly grateful for the opportunity and hope to stay in touch as I embark on this next chapter.  

Thank you again for your understanding and support. I wish you and the team continued success, and I hope our paths cross again in the future.  

Warm regards,  
[Your Full Name]

### Key Considerations Addressed:  
1. **Gratitude/Appreciation**: Opens and closes with sincere thanks, acknowledging the receiver’s effort.  
2. **Avoiding Harshness**: Softens the decline with phrases like “difficult decision” and “careful reflection.”  
3. **Supervisor-Student Dynamic**: Maintains respect and professionalism while being transparent about priorities.  
4. **Future Relationships**: Leaves the door open for future connections (“hope to stay in touch”).  

This strikes a balance between clarity and warmth, ensuring the receiver feels respected rather than disappointed. Let me know if you'd like any adjustments!
