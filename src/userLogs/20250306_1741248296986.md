Subject: Update on Job Offer Acceptance

Dear Mr. Tom,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to inform you of a change in my career plans after careful consideration. Although I initially accepted the offer from your esteemed company, I have decided not to proceed with the position.

I have chosen to pursue a research assistant role at a local university, with the aim of furthering my education through a PhD program. This decision aligns more closely with my long-term academic goals.

I deeply appreciate the opportunity and the support from your team. Thank you for your understanding, and I wish you and the company continued success.

Best regards,

[Your Full Name]
