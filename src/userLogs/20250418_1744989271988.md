**Subject:** Withdrawing My Acceptance of the Job Offer  

Dear Mr. Tom,  

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to sincerely thank you for the opportunity to join [Company Name] and for the time and effort you and your team have invested in me throughout the hiring process.  

After careful reflection, I’ve made the difficult decision to withdraw my acceptance of the job offer. While I was initially excited about the role, I’ve recently been presented with an opportunity to work as a research assistant at [Local University], which aligns more closely with my long-term goal of pursuing a PhD. This academic path is something I’ve been passionate about for some time, and I feel it’s the right step for my future.  

I deeply regret any inconvenience this may cause and want to express my genuine appreciation for your understanding and support. I have great respect for your organization and the work you do, and this decision was not made lightly.  

Thank you again for the trust you placed in me, and I hope our paths may cross again in the future. Please let me know if there’s anything I can do to assist with the transition.  

Warm regards,  
[Your Full Name]

### Key Tone Considerations:  
1. **Gratitude/Appreciation**: Repeated thanks and acknowledgment of the opportunity soften the message.  
2. **Professionalism**: Clear reasoning (academic goals) avoids ambiguity while maintaining respect.  
3. **Regret Without Over-Apologizing**: Acknowledges inconvenience but doesn’t dwell on guilt.  
4. **Future Relationship**: Leaves the door open for positive interactions later.  

This balances your need to decline the offer firmly yet graciously while preserving your professional reputation. Let me know if you'd like any adjustments!
