Subject: Withdrawal of Job Offer Acceptance

Dear Mr. Tom,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to express my sincere apologies for any inconvenience caused, but I must withdraw my acceptance of the job offer from your company. 

After careful consideration, I have decided to pursue a research assistant position at a local university, with the hopes of advancing towards a PhD degree in the future. This opportunity aligns more closely with my long-term career aspirations.

I am truly grateful for your understanding and the offer extended to me. I regret any disruption my decision may cause and appreciate your support during this transitional period.

Best regards,

[Your Full Name]
