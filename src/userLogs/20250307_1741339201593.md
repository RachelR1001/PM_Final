Subject: Inquiry on Master Thesis Grant Support  

Dear Professor Cindy,  

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to follow up on our previous discussion regarding the $750 support from the master thesis grant. Could you let me know if you still wish to proceed with the support?  

If so, could you please advise on how the funds can be disbursed? I am comfortable with either cash or a bank transfer, depending on your preference.  

Thank you very much for your continued support and guidance. I truly appreciate it and look forward to your response.  

Best regards,  
[Your Name]
