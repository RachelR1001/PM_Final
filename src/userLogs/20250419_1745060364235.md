**Subject:** Withdrawing My Acceptance of the Job Offer  

Dear Mr. Tom,  

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to sincerely thank you for the opportunity to join [Company Name] and for the time and effort you and your team have invested in my candidacy. After much reflection, however, I’ve made the difficult decision to withdraw my acceptance of the offer.  

While I was initially excited about the role, I’ve recently been presented with an opportunity to work as a research assistant at [Local University], which aligns closely with my long-term goal of pursuing a PhD. This academic path is a deeply personal priority, and after careful consideration, I believe it’s the right direction for me at this stage.  

I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and greatly appreciate your understanding. I’m truly grateful for the kindness and support you’ve shown me throughout the hiring process, and I hope to stay in touch as my career progresses.  

Thank you again for the opportunity, and I wish you and the entire team at [Company Name] continued success.  

Best regards,  
[Your Full Name]

### Key Tone Adjustments:  
1. **Gratitude/Appreciation**: Repeated thanks and acknowledgment of their effort soften the withdrawal.  
2. **Ownership of Mistake ("Our side")**: Phrases like *"difficult decision"* and *"sincerely apologize"* show accountability.  
3. **Neutral-to-Warm Closure**: Leaves the door open for future contact without overpromising.  

Let me know if you'd like any refinements!
