**Subject:** Update on My Job Acceptance  

Dear Mr. Tom,  

I hope this email finds you well. I’m writing to share an update regarding my earlier acceptance of the job offer at [Company Name]. After much reflection, I’ve decided to pursue a position as a research assistant at a local university to further my goal of earning a PhD in the future.  

I’m deeply grateful for the opportunity you and the team extended to me, and I sincerely appreciate the time and consideration you’ve given me throughout the hiring process. This was not an easy decision, but I believe this academic path aligns more closely with my long-term aspirations.  

I regret any inconvenience this may cause and want to thank you again for your understanding. I’ve truly valued the chance to engage with your team, and I hope our paths might cross again in the future.  

Wishing you and the company continued success.  

Best regards,  
[Your Full Name]

### Why this works:  
- **Gratitude-focused**: Repeated thanks and acknowledgment of the opportunity soften the decline.  
- **Introverted tone**: Polite, slightly formal, and avoids over-explaining while remaining warm.  
- **Maintains distance respectfully**: No false promises of future collaboration, but leaves the door open neutrally.  
- **Avoids harshness**: No blame or negativity—centers on your own growth (“I’ve decided” vs. “the job wasn’t right”).  

Let me know if you'd like any adjustments!
