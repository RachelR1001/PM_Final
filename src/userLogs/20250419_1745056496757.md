**Subject:** Update Regarding My Job Offer Acceptance  

Dear Mr. Tom,  

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to sincerely thank you for the opportunity to join [Company Name] and for the time and effort you and your team have invested in my candidacy. I deeply appreciate the trust you placed in me by extending the offer, and I was genuinely excited about the prospect of contributing to your organization.  

However, after careful reflection, I’ve decided to pursue a role as a research assistant at a local university to further my long-term goal of earning a PhD. This path aligns closely with my academic aspirations, and I felt it was important to be transparent with you about my decision.  

I truly regret any inconvenience this may cause and want to express my gratitude for your understanding. I’ve greatly admired the work culture at [Company Name], and I hope our paths might cross again in the future. Thank you again for your kindness and support throughout this process.  

Wishing you and the team continued success.  

Best regards,  
[Your Full Name]
