**Subject:** Update Regarding My Job Offer Acceptance  

Dear Mr. Tom,  

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to sincerely thank you for the opportunity to join [Company Name] and for the time and effort you and your team have invested in my candidacy. After careful reflection, I’ve made the difficult decision not to proceed with the role, as I’ve chosen to accept a position as a research assistant at [Local University] to pursue my long-term goal of earning a PhD.  

This was not an easy choice, as I deeply appreciate the trust and support you’ve extended to me. However, I believe this academic path aligns more closely with my aspirations at this stage of my career. I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and am truly grateful for your understanding.  

Thank you again for the opportunity and for your kindness throughout the process. I wish you and the team continued success, and I hope our paths may cross again in the future.  

Best regards,  
[Your Full Name]

### Key Tone Adjustments:  
- **Gratitude-first approach**: Opens and closes with appreciation to soften the declination.  
- **Clarity with humility**: Explicitly states the reason (academic pursuit) without over-explaining or sounding defensive.  
- **Professional warmth**: Acknowledges the difficulty of the decision and avoids burning bridges ("hope our paths cross").  

Let me know if you'd like any refinements!
