It's about [briefly explain the situation or topic without going into too much detail yet].

I know you're always really busy and have a lot on your plate, and I completely understand if now isn't a good time or if it's not something you can help with. No pressure at all! But I really value your [mention the quality that makes them "higher" in this context, e.g., insights, experience, network] and thought it wouldn't hurt to ask.

Let me know if you have a spare moment and are open to chatting/helping. Even a quick thought would be hugely appreciated.

Catch up soon,

[Your Name]
