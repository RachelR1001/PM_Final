**Subject:** Just wanted to say thank you  

Hey [Friend's Name],  

I hope you're doing well! I’ve been meaning to reach out because I’ve been thinking lately about how much I appreciate you. The way you [specific action or trait—e.g., "always listen without judgment" or "went out of your way to help me last week"] really means a lot to me. It’s one of those things that might seem small, but it makes a big difference.  

I’m not always the best at putting these things into words, but I wanted you to know how grateful I am to have you in my life. Your kindness and thoughtfulness don’t go unnoticed—even if I don’t say it often enough.  

Anyway, just wanted to share that. Hope we can catch up soon!  

Take care,  
[Your Name]
