**Subject:** Just thinking of you ðŸ’›  

Hi Mom,  

I hope you're doing well! I was just sitting here with my coffee, thinking about how much I miss our long chats and all the little moments weâ€™ve shared. Remember that time we baked cookies together and ended up with flour everywhere? I still laugh every time I think about itâ€”those are the memories that make me smile the most.  

Lifeâ€™s been busy, but good. Work is keeping me on my toes, and Iâ€™ve been trying to take more walks in the eveningsâ€”it reminds me of our walks around the neighborhood when I was younger. Iâ€™d love to hear how youâ€™ve been, too. Whatâ€™s new with you? Any fun plans coming up?  

I just wanted to say how grateful I am for you. Even though weâ€™re not always in the same place, youâ€™re always in my heart. Letâ€™s plan a call soonâ€”Iâ€™d love to hear your voice and catch up properly.  

Sending you the biggest hug,  
[Your Name]
