Subject: Thinking of you!

Hey [Friend's Name],

Hope this email finds you well! It feels like it's been a little while since we properly chatted, and with [mention a recent event or shared memory if applicable, e.g., the changing seasons, that funny thing we saw last time we were together], I just wanted to reach out and say hello.

Distance is a funny thing, isn't it? It definitely adds a layer of logistical fun to staying connected, but it certainly doesn't diminish how much I value our friendship. I've been thinking about you and what you've been up to lately.

I'd love to hear what's been going on in your world â€“ big things, little things, anything and everything! How are things with [mention something specific about their life if you know, e.g., work, hobbies, family]? Great news!

On my end, [share a brief update about your life - keep it relatively brief and positive to encourage them to share too]. It's definitely different being [where you are], but [mention something good about it, e.g., I'm getting used to it, it has its perks].

Anyway, mostly just wanted to drop you a line and bridge the gap a little. Hope you're doing great.

Warmly,

[Your Name]
