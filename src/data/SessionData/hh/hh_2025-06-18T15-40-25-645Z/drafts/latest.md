**Subject:** Thank You for Everything ❤️  

Hi Mom,  

I just wanted to take a moment to say how much I appreciate you. Lately, I’ve been thinking about all the little (and big) ways you’ve been there for me, and it means more than I can put into words.  

Whether it’s the way you checked in on me last week when I was stressed about work, or how you always know how to make me laugh when I need it most—those things make such a difference. You have this incredible way of making me feel supported and loved, even when life gets overwhelming.  

I don’t say it enough, but I’m so grateful to have you in my corner. Your kindness and strength inspire me, and I hope you know how much I admire you.  

Thank you for being you—I love you so much!  

[Your Name]
