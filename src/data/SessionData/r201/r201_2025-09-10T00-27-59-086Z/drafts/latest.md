Dear Professor [Supervisor's Last Name],

I am writing to you today with an urgent and sensitive matter regarding my PhD stipend. As you know, my current funding is set to expire in approximately one month, and I am incredibly grateful for the support I have received thus far.

Unfortunately, I have recently faced a significant personal challenge. My father has become seriously ill, which has placed an unexpected and considerable financial strain on my family. While I am fully committed to my research and making progress on my thesis, this situation has temporarily made it necessary for me to contribute more significantly to my family's financial needs.

Given these circumstances, I would be profoundly grateful if it were possible to request a three-month extension to my stipend. This additional funding would provide crucial temporary support for my family during this difficult period, allowing me to continue my studies without the added burden of immediate financial precarity.

I want to assure you that my dedication to my PhD research remains unwavering. I am committed to working diligently during this extended period and will ensure that this personal challenge does not impede my academic progress. I am confident that with this temporary assistance, I can continue to make substantial strides towards the completion of my thesis.

Thank you for considering my request and for your understanding during this challenging time. I would be very happy to discuss this further with you at your convenience.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
