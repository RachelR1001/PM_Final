**Subject:** Just wanted to say thank you ðŸ’›  

Hi Mom,  

Iâ€™ve been thinking a lot lately about how lucky I am to have you, and I just wanted to take a moment to tell you how much I appreciate everything you do. Whether itâ€™s the way you always know exactly what to say when Iâ€™m stressed, or how you still make my favorite comfort foods when I visit (your chicken soup truly has healing powers!), Iâ€™m so grateful for your love and support.  

I was remembering the time you drove all the way to my apartment during finals week with a care packageâ€”snacks, notes, and even that ridiculous stress-relief squishy toy. It meant the world to me then, and it still does now. You have this way of making even the toughest days feel manageable, and I donâ€™t tell you often enough how much that matters to me.  

Thank you for being my rock, my cheerleader, and my favorite person to call when I need a laugh or a pep talk. I hope you know how much I love and admire you.  

Sending you the biggest hug,  
[Your Name]
