Subject: Urgent: Quick look needed on [Your Project/Thesis Area] draft

Hi Professor [Professor's Last Name],

Hope you're having a good week.

I'm writing with a somewhat urgent request for a quick review of the [specific section, e.g., methodology chapter, experimental design, preliminary results] of my [Project/Thesis Title].

I've hit a point where I need your feedback on [briefly explain the specific area of concern or question, e.g., whether my proposed analysis method is sound, if my interpretation of these initial results is correct, if I'm on the right track with the next steps]. Without a quick green light or guidance on this, I'm unable to move forward effectively on the next phase, which is currently on a tight timeline.

I've attached the relevant section for your convenience. If there's any way you might be able to take a quick look sometime today or tomorrow, it would be incredibly helpful and prevent a significant delay.

Following up on our discussion, please find attached our updated proposal, which reflects your valuable insights and provides a clearer path forward.

Best regards,
