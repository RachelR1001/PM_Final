Subject: Urgent Request: Stipend Extension & Family Support

Dear Professor [Supervisor's Last Name],

I hope this email finds you well.

I'm writing to you today with a personal matter, and I sincerely apologize for the timing. As you know, my current stipend is due to expire in one month. I've recently encountered a difficult family situation, and I'm exploring all possible avenues to ensure I can continue my research without interruption during this challenging period.

My father has fallen critically ill, creating an unexpected and temporary, yet significant, need for me to provide additional financial support to my family. This situation has been quite challenging to navigate, both personally and logistically, and I am committed to ensuring my family's well-being while steadfastly continuing to progress with my PhD research.

I understand that this is an unusual request, and I deeply regret any inconvenience or additional burden it may place on you or the department. I have always been incredibly grateful for your consistent guidance and unwavering support throughout my PhD, and I truly value our positive working relationship. My dedication to my research remains absolute, and I am confident that with this three-month extension, I can navigate this difficult personal period without compromising the quality or timeline of my academic work. I am fully prepared to outline a revised research plan to demonstrate how I will maintain progress effectively.
