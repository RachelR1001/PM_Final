      "modification_name": "Shift from Direct Request to Indirect Hinting in Statement of Purpose",
      "original_text": "I'm writing to you today with a rather urgent and personal matter, and I sincerely apologize for the timing. As you know, my current stipend is due to expire in one month. Unfortunately, I've recently encountered a difficult family situation that necessitates me requesting a three-month extension to my stipend.",
      "revised_text": "I'm writing to you today with a personal matter, and I sincerely apologize for the timing. As you know, my current stipend is due to expire in one month. I've recently encountered a difficult family situation, and I'm exploring all possible avenues to ensure I can continue my research without interruption during this challenging period.",
      "modification_reason": "The user wanted to make the request for a stipend extension more indirect and hint at the need rather than state it explicitly. This aligns with the 'be indirect and hint at need' user edit reason and softens the initial approach, potentially to avoid appearing demanding or creating immediate pressure on the supervisor.",
      "receiver_description": "Academic supervisor (Professor, Male) with whom the sender has a friendly/warm affiliation. The supervisor holds power and influence over the sender's academic and financial situation.",
      "occasion_description": "A PhD student needs to request a 3-month stipend extension from their supervisor due to an unexpected family illness requiring financial support. The communication aims to inform and make a request, while conveying gratitude/appreciation and apology/regret, and avoiding appearing disrespectful/aggressive. The student wishes to be indirect about the request initially."

      "modification_name": "Emphasize severity and commitment for a sensitive request",
      "original_text": "My father has fallen ill, and this has created an unexpected and temporary need for me to provide additional financial support to my family. This situation has been quite challenging, and I am committed to ensuring my family's well-being while continuing to progress with my PhD research.",
      "revised_text": "My father has fallen critically ill, creating an unexpected and temporary, yet significant, need for me to provide additional financial support to my family. This situation has been quite challenging to navigate, both personally and logistically, and I am committed to ensuring my family's well-being while steadfastly continuing to progress with my PhD research.",
      "modification_reason": "The user expanded the sentence to add more detail and emphasize the critical nature of their father's illness ('critically ill'), the significance of the financial need ('yet significant'), and the challenging aspects of the situation ('both personally and logistically'). This modification also highlights their unwavering commitment to their research ('steadfastly continuing') despite the personal difficulties, aiming to convey seriousness and dedication to their supervisor when asking for an extension and funding.",
      "receiver_description": "Academic supervisor (Professor, Male) with whom the sender has a friendly/warm relationship. The supervisor is an authority figure in an academic setting.",
      "occasion_description": "A PhD student is writing to their supervisor to request a 3-month stipend extension due to a critical family illness requiring the student to provide financial support. The communication aims to inform and request, while conveying gratitude and apology, and avoiding appearing disrespectful or aggressive. The request is sensitive and requires careful phrasing to secure approval."

      "modification_name": "Enhance Apology and Reassurance for Stipend Extension Request",
      "original_text": "I understand that this is an unusual request, and I deeply regret any inconvenience it may cause. I have always been incredibly grateful for your guidance and support throughout my PhD, and I truly value our working relationship. I am dedicated to my research and am confident that this extension would allow me to navigate this difficult period without compromising the quality or timeline of my academic work.",
      "revised_text": "I understand that this is an unusual request, and I deeply regret any inconvenience or additional burden it may place on you or the department. I have always been incredibly grateful for your consistent guidance and unwavering support throughout my PhD, and I truly value our positive working relationship. My dedication to my research remains absolute, and I am confident that with this three-month extension, I can navigate this difficult personal period without compromising the quality or timeline of my academic work. I am fully prepared to outline a revised research plan to demonstrate how I will maintain progress effectively.",
      "modification_reason": "The user wanted to add more details, specifically by broadening the apology to include the 'department' and 'additional burden', intensifying gratitude with 'consistent' and 'unwavering' support, emphasizing dedication with 'absolute', and proactively offering a 'revised research plan' to address potential concerns about academic progress during the requested 3-month stipend extension. This addresses the 'requests' and 'Apology / Regret' communication purposes and desired emotions while mitigating the risk of appearing 'Disrespectful / Aggressive'.",
      "receiver_description": "Academic supervisor (Professor, Male) with whom the sender has a 'Friendly / Warm' affiliation. The receiver is in a position of authority regarding funding and academic progress.",
      "occasion_description": "A PhD student is requesting a three-month stipend extension from their supervisor due to a personal family emergency (father's illness) requiring temporary financial support for their family. The communication involves making a sensitive request, expressing gratitude, and conveying regret for any inconvenience, while reassuring the supervisor of continued academic commitment and avoiding any perception of disrespect."

      "modification_name": "Replaced Call to Action with Introduction/Apology",
      "original_text": "I would be very grateful for the opportunity to discuss this further with you at your earliest convenience. I am happy to provide any additional information you might require and to outline how I plan to manage my research commitments during this period.",
      "revised_text": "I'm writing to you today with a personal matter, and I sincerely apologize for the timing. As you know, my current stipend is due to expire in one month. I've recently encountered a difficult family situation, and I'm exploring all possible avenues to ensure I can continue my research without interruption during this challenging period.",
      "modification_reason": "The user replaced the suggested 'Call to Action' with a paragraph that reiterates the initial reason for writing and the difficult personal situation, which was already present earlier in the draft. This suggests the user might have accidentally overwritten the 'Call to Action' with a repeated introductory paragraph, or they intended to move this introductory statement to a different section, rather than creating a new 'Call to Action'. Given the 'quickfix' reason, it's likely a misclick or an attempt to move content, rather than a deliberate redefinition of the call to action.",
      "receiver_description": "Academic supervisor (Professor); Male; has a Friendly/Warm affiliation with the sender. The receiver is expected to provide funding/support.",
      "occasion_description": "A PhD student is requesting a 3-month stipend extension from their supervisor due to a family illness (father's critical illness) requiring financial support. The student needs to convey gratitude, appreciation, apology, and regret while avoiding being perceived as disrespectful or aggressive. The communication purpose is to inform and request."
