**Subject:** Thank You for Everything  

Hi Momo,  

I hope you're doing well. I’ve been thinking a lot lately about how much your support has meant to me over the years, and I just wanted to take a moment to say thank you. You’ve been such an important part of my life, and I’ll always be grateful for the kindness and care you’ve shown me.  

Life has a way of pulling us in different directions, and I’ve been feeling the need to step back and focus on some things for myself right now. I hope you understand. Even as things change, I’ll always cherish the memories and the warmth you brought into my world.  

Wishing you all the best, always.  

Take care,  
[Your Name]
