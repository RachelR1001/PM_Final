**Subject:** So Grateful for You  

Hey [Friend's Name],  

I just wanted to take a moment to say how much I appreciate you. Whether itâ€™s the way you always know how to lift my spirits or the little things you do without even thinkingâ€”like that time you surprised me with [specific memory, e.g., "my favorite coffee when I was having a rough week"]â€”it never goes unnoticed. You have such a knack for making people feel seen, and Iâ€™m so lucky to have you in my life.  

Iâ€™d love to return the kindness soon. How about we plan a [coffee/lunch/walk/etc.] next week? My treatâ€”itâ€™s the least I can do! Let me know what works for you.  

Thanks again for being you. ðŸ’›  

[Your Name]
