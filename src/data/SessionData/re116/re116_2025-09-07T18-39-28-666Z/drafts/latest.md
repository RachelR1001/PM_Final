Dear Professor Z,

I hope this email finds you well.

I am writing to you today with an urgent request regarding [briefly state the core issue, e.g., the deadline for the upcoming assignment / a specific query about a course concept]. I sincerely apologize for the short notice, and I understand this may cause an inconvenience. The issue on my end is [briefly and clearly explain the mistake/reason, e.g., due to an oversight on my part, I only just realized the submission portal closes sooner than I thought / I made an error in understanding the requirements for X].

I am very eager to [state your goal, e.g., submit my best work / fully grasp this concept] and am prepared to put in the necessary effort to rectify this. Would it be possible to [clearly state your specific request, e.g., request a brief extension until [date/time] / schedule a very quick meeting at your earliest convenience to clarify / ask if there's any immediate resource you could point me to]?

I understand your time is valuable, and I am incredibly grateful for your consideration. Thank you so much for your understanding and support.

Sincerely,
