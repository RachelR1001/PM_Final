**Subject:** Just wanted to say thank you ðŸ’›  

Hi Mom,  

Iâ€™ve been thinking a lot lately about how lucky I am to have you, and I just wanted to take a moment to tell you how much I appreciate everything you do. From the little thingsâ€”like how you always remember to ask about my day, even when yours has been busyâ€”to the big things, like the way youâ€™ve always been my biggest cheerleader, no matter what.  

Iâ€™ll never forget how you stayed up with me all those nights when I was stressed about school, or how you somehow always know the exact right thing to say when Iâ€™m feeling down. Your kindness and patience amaze me, and I hope you know how much it means to me.  

Thank you for being youâ€”for your warmth, your wisdom, and your endless love. I donâ€™t say it enough, but Iâ€™m so grateful to have you in my corner.  

Love you lots,  
[Your Name]
