      "revised_text": "Dear Professor [Professor's Last Name],",
      "modification_reason": "The user's stated reason was 'direct and formal'. The current opening salutation 'Dear Professor [Professor's Last Name],' already aligns with a direct and formal tone suitable for addressing a professor, especially when the familiarity is 'Strangers' and the affiliation is 'Neutral'. Therefore, no change was made, indicating the existing text met the user's intent for formality.",
      "receiver_description": "A female professor whom the sender does not know (Strangers), in a professional academic context, where the sender aims to convey gratitude and excitement.",
      "occasion_description": "An initial email to a professor (Professor X) where the sender is informing and persuading, while also conveying gratitude and excitement, and aiming to avoid being harsh. The context requires a formal and respectful tone."
