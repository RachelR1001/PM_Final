**Subject:** Just wanted to say thank you ðŸ’›  

Hey [Friend's Name],  

Iâ€™ve been thinking about how much your support meant to me [recently/when you did X]. Itâ€™s one of those things that sticks with you, you know? I donâ€™t always say it out loud, but Iâ€™m so grateful to have you in my corner.  

It reminded me of [shared memory or experience], and how youâ€™ve always been there, even when Iâ€™m not the best at asking for help. That kind of quiet understanding is rare, and I just wanted you to know how much I value it.  

Anyway, Iâ€™d love to catch up properly soonâ€”maybe over coffee or a walk, if youâ€™re up for it? No pressure, just whenever works.  

Thanks again for being you.  

[Your Name]
