**Subject:** Just Wanted to Say Thank You ðŸ’›  

Hi Mom,  

I hope you're doing well. Iâ€™ve been thinking about you a lot lately and just wanted to take a moment to say how much I appreciate everything you do. Even the little thingsâ€”like your texts checking in or the way you always seem to know when I need encouragementâ€”mean so much to me.  

Lifeâ€™s been moving along steadily here. Work is keeping me busy, but Iâ€™ve been trying to carve out time for small joys, like reading in the evenings or taking quiet walks. Itâ€™s in those moments that I often find myself feeling grateful for the warmth and care youâ€™ve always shown me.  

I donâ€™t say it enough, but your support has been such a grounding force in my life. Thank you for being youâ€”for your patience, your kindness, and the love you pour into everything.  

Sending you a big hug and so much love.  

[Your Name]
