**Subject:** Thank You for Being Awesome!  

Hey [Friend's Name],  

I just wanted to take a moment to say how much I appreciate you. That time you [specific act of support, e.g., "helped me move apartments last-minute"] really meant the world to me—I don’t know what I’d do without you!  

It reminded me of [personal anecdote, e.g., "when we tackled that crazy IKEA furniture assembly together and laughed the whole time"]. You always make even the toughest situations feel lighter.  

Let’s catch up soon! How about we [suggest meet-up, e.g., "grab coffee next weekend"]? My treat—it’s the least I can do to return the favor.  

Thanks again for being such an incredible friend.  

[Your Name]
