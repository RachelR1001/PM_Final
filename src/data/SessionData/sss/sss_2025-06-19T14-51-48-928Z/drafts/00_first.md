**Subject:** Thank You for Everything  

Hi Mom,  

I just wanted to take a moment to tell you how much I appreciate you. I’ve been thinking a lot lately about all the little (and big) things you do that make such a difference—like the way you always remember to ask about my day, even when you’re busy, or how you somehow know exactly when to send a funny meme to cheer me up.  

I’ll never forget how you stayed up with me during finals week in college, sending encouraging texts and care packages. Or the time you drove an hour just to bring me soup when I was sick. Those moments mean more to me than I can say.  

You have this incredible way of making people feel loved and supported, and I’m so lucky to have you as my mom. Thank you for always being my rock. I hope you know how much I admire and appreciate you.  

Love you always,  
[Your Name]
