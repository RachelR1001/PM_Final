Dear Professor [Supervisor's Last Name],

I hope this email finds you well.

I am writing to you today regarding a developing situation that has implications for my ability to focus fully on my PhD research, particularly concerning my funding. As you know, my current stipend is set to expire in one month. Unfortunately, I've recently encountered an unexpected family situation that has placed me in a difficult financial position. My father has become quite ill, and I need to temporarily provide more substantial support for my family.

This unforeseen circumstance has created a temporary need for additional funding on my part. I am hoping to respectfully request a three-month extension to my stipend to help navigate this challenging period. I sincerely apologize for the timing of this request and any inconvenience it may cause. I'm incredibly grateful for the support I've received so far during my PhD, and this situation is entirely external to my dedication to my research.

I understand this is a significant request, and I'm happy to discuss how I can continue to make progress on my research during this period. Please let me know if you would be available to chat sometime next week to discuss this further.

Thank you very much for your understanding and consideration.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
