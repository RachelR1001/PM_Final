Subject: Deepest Apologies Regarding [Paper Title] Submission

Dear [Supervisor's Name],

I am writing to offer my sincerest and deepest apologies for a significant oversight in the submission process for our paper, "[Paper Title]," which has recently been accepted to [Conference Name].

In the rush of meeting the submission deadline, I regrettably failed to include your name in the author list. This was a grave error on my part, and I take full and unreserved responsibility for this lapse in judgment. I understand the significant professional impact this has, especially considering your invaluable guidance and contributions throughout the research and writing process. There are no excuses for this oversight.

The paper has now been accepted, and unfortunately, the conference policy strictly prohibits adding authors at this stage. I am truly heartbroken that my mistake has led to this outcome and that your essential contribution will not be formally acknowledged on the publication.

I understand the importance of acknowledging all contributors, and I deeply regret that my error has resulted in this situation. I am committed to ensuring that such a mistake never happens again in any future collaborative work. I value our working relationship immensely and am acutely aware that this oversight could potentially impact future collaboration opportunities. Please be assured that this was an isolated incident stemming purely from my inattentiveness during a critical stage.

, and once again, I am profoundly sorry for this mistake and the negative consequences it has caused.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
