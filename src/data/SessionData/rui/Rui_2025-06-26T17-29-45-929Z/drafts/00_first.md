Subject: Deepest Apologies Regarding the Conference Paper Submission

Dear Professor [Supervisor's Last Name],

I am writing to you with a profound sense of regret and embarrassment regarding the recent submission of our paper to [Top Conference Name].

As you know, we received notification that the paper has been accepted, which is incredibly exciting news. However, in my haste and oversight during the submission process, I made a significant error and failed to include your name in the author list.

I am absolutely devastated by this mistake. Your guidance, invaluable insights, and substantial contributions were fundamental to this research and the success of this paper. I am keenly aware that your contribution level was significant, and the omission of your name is a serious oversight that potentially deprives you of deserved academic recognition and credit for your hard work. I am deeply sorry for any impact this may have on your academic record and standing.

I have already contacted the conference organizers to explain the situation and request that your name be added, but I have been informed that they do not allow author additions at this stage of the process. I understand this is not the outcome either of us would have wanted, and I feel tremendous personal anxiety and embarrassment over this oversight.

This was a completely unintentional error, born out of carelessness on my part during a stressful deadline. There is no excuse for it, and I take full responsibility.

I wanted to inform you immediately, especially given the final acceptance status of the paper. I am truly sorry for this lapse in judgment and for any inconvenience or disappointment it may cause you.

I hope this incident will not damage our working relationship, which I deeply value. I am committed to ensuring this never happens again and that proper attribution is always given in all future collaborations.

Thank you for your understanding and for everything you have done for this research.

With sincere apologies,

[Your Name]
