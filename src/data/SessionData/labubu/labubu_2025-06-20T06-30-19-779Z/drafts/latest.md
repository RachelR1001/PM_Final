**Subject:** Hey, just checking in!

Hi Zimomo,

Hope you're doing great! It's been a while since we last caught up, and I just wanted to drop you a quick note to see how things are going on your end.

I’ve been keeping busy—[insert personal update or shared interest here, e.g., "finally got around to starting that new show we talked about, and wow, it’s as good as you said!"]. How about you? Anything fun or exciting happening lately?

Let’s not wait too long before we chat again. Maybe we can grab coffee (or a virtual hangout) soon? Would love to hear what’s new with you.

Take care, and talk soon!

[Your Name]
