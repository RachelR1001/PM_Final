**Subject:** Thank You for Your Help on the Project  

Hi Molly,  

I just wanted to take a moment to sincerely thank you for stepping in to help with the client presentation last week. Your attention to detail—especially when you caught that discrepancy in the data—made a huge difference. I know it was a tight deadline, and your willingness to jump in was incredibly appreciated.  

The final version turned out so much stronger because of your input, and the client’s positive feedback was a direct result of your effort. You really saved the day!  

If there’s ever a way I can return the favor, don’t hesitate to ask. Maybe we can grab coffee soon and celebrate the win?  

Thanks again—you’re a rockstar!  

Best,  
[Your Name]
