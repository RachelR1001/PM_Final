**Subject:** Just wanted to say thank you ðŸ’›  

Hi Mom,  

I was thinking about you today and realized I donâ€™t say it enoughâ€”thank you. For so many little things, like how you always know exactly what to say when Iâ€™m stressed (even when I donâ€™t ask), or how youâ€™d pack my lunch with those little notes that made me smile. I still remember coming home from school to the smell of your chocolate chip cookies, and how it felt like everything was right in the world.  

Youâ€™ve always been my safe place, and Iâ€™m so grateful for that. Even now, just hearing your voice makes my day brighter. I hope you know how much you mean to meâ€”not just for what you do, but for who you are. The way you love so deeply and laugh so easily is something Iâ€™ll always admire.  

Anyway, I just wanted to remind you how much I appreciate you. Sending you the biggest hug!  

Love,  
[Your Name]
