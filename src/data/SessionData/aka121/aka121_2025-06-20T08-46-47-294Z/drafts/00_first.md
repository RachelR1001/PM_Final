**Subject:** Thank You for Everything ❤️  

Hi Mom,  

I just wanted to take a moment to tell you how much I appreciate you. Lately, I’ve been thinking about all the little (and big!) ways you’ve been there for me, and it means more than I can say. Whether it’s your encouraging texts when I’m stressed, the way you always remember my favorite snacks when I visit, or just knowing I can count on you no matter what—it all adds up to so much love and support.  

I don’t say it enough, but I’m truly grateful for you. You have this way of making even the toughest days feel lighter, and I hope you know how much that matters to me.  

Sending you a big hug and lots of love. Let’s plan a call or visit soon—I’d love to hear how you’re doing too!  

Love always,  
[Your Name]
