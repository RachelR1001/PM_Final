**Subject:** Just wanted to say thank you ðŸ’›  

Hi Mom,  

I was thinking about you today and realized I havenâ€™t told you lately how much I appreciate you. Seriously, youâ€™re the best.  

Remember when I was stressing about [specific event, e.g., "that big work project"] last month? You dropping off my favorite homemade soup and just sitting with me for a bit made all the difference. Little things like thatâ€”or how you always know the exact right thing to say when Iâ€™m feeling overwhelmedâ€”mean so much.  

I donâ€™t know how you do it, but youâ€™ve always had this way of making everything feel lighter. Even now, just writing this, Iâ€™m smiling thinking about [shared memory, e.g., "our impromptu ice cream runs when I was a kid"].  

Anyway, I just wanted you to know how grateful I am for you. Youâ€™re my rock, and I love you tons.  

Talk soon? Maybe we can plan a [casual activity, e.g., "coffee date"] next week!  

Love,  
[Your Name]
