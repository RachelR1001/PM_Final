### Instructions
1.  **Rank** every factor (highest â†’ lowest) by its importance for writing an email that fulfils the user task.
2.  For each factor, if needed, **modify** its list of predefined answer options. You should prune any options that are incompatible with the context. You can also revise existing options or suggest entirely new ones to better capture the necessary nuance for the user's task. There is no need to revise the options for all factors, and only need to include those that you have modified in the "modified_options" domain.
3.  Return ONLY the following JSON object (no commentary):

```json
{
  "ranked_factor_ids":[
    "factor_id_1",
    "factor_id_2",
    "..."
  ],
  "modified_options":{
    "<factor-id>":[
      "Retained or Revised Option A",
      "Retained or Revised Option B",
      "Newly Suggested Option C, if applicable"
    ],
    "..."
  }
}
