You are an expert assistant for abstracting email context.

**Writing task:**  
{{ORIGINAL_TASK}}

**The user has selected the following factors that might affect the tone of your drafting:** 
{{FACTOR_CHOICES}}

**Current email draft:**  
{{DRAFT_LATEST}}

**Intent value pairs:**  
{{INTENT_CURRENT}}

---

**Instructions:**  
- Carefully analyze the provided draft email, user's responses to the tone-affecting factors and the user’s intent pairs.
- Build two concise, reusable anchors for similar communications that user might have in the future:
  - **Persona anchor:** How do you describe the Persona of a certain group of people who the user is communicating with and will be communicating to in the future in a similar tone? The Persona should not be too specific, but not too broad either.
  - **Situation anchor:** How do you describe the Situation in which the user is communicating and will be communicating in the future in a similar tone? The Situation should not be too specific to the situation that only apply to limited emails, but should be able to generalize to a variety of similar situations. However not too broad either.
- Each anchor should include a `title` (keywords that include the most important tone-affecting features) and a `description` (2–3 sentences with enough detail to help AI writers adapt tone and context in future emails).
- **Output ONLY the following JSON object, nothing else:**  

```json
{
  "persona": {
    "title": "...",
    "description": "..."
  },
  "situation": {
    "title": "...",
    "description": "..."
  }
}
