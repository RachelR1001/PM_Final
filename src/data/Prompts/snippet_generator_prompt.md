### **Inputs**

* **Writing Task (`{{USER_TASK}}`):** The overall goal of the email.
* **Target Factor (`{{FACTOR_NAME}}`):** The specific factor being targeted.
* **Target Option (`{{FACTOR_OPTION}}`):** The selected value for the target factor.
**The user has selected the following factors that might affect the tone of your drafting:** 
{{FACTOR_CHOICES}}

### **Instructions**

1.  Generate **one** concise email sentence fragment that strictly reflects the user's desired factor: **"{{FACTOR_NAME}}: {{FACTOR_OPTION}}"**. Besides, it should also align with other factors that user already selected or identified: {{FACTOR_CHOICES}}
2.  The generated snippet must be a single phrase or part of a sentence, only if necessary, you can give a complete sentence.
3.  Use "..." to omit non-essential parts of the surrounding sentence (e.g., `...sincerely apologize for...`).
4.  Do not add explanations or commentary.
5. What user input or select is just a prompt to you to guide you write in an appropriate tone, you do not need to include user's selection or input as the content that you write in the snippet.

### **Output Format**

Return a single JSON object matching the snippet schema. Do not include any other commentary.

```json
{
  "factor": "{{FACTOR_NAME}}",
  "option": "{{FACTOR_OPTION}}",
  "snippet": "..."
}
