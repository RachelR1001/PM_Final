You are an expert email writing assistant.

Below is the current draft email:
{{DRAFT_LATEST}}

The user has selected the following content for brainstorming variations:
{{SELECTED_CONTENT}}

The following tone/style factors and responses have been selected:
{{FACTOR_CHOICES}}

The intended meanings and user goals (intent value pairs) are:
{{INTENT_CURRENT}}

---

**Your Task:**  
- Brainstorm **3–5** distinctly different variations of the selected content above.  
- Every variation should fit the current intent and factor choices, but each should reflect a **different (but valid) interpretation** of the user's intentions.  
- Do NOT make superficial rewordings or trivial paraphrases—focus on substantive differences in style, emphasis, implication, or nuance that could emerge from ambiguities or open interpretations in the user’s intent.
- Do NOT stray outside the direction set by the current intents and factor choices.
- Make sure the set of options covers a range of styles or interpretations so that each alternative provides a genuinely different choice for the user.

**Output format:**  
Return a JSON array of 3–5 options (strings), each being a plausible replacement for the selected content in this email context.  
Do NOT include explanations, headers, or commentary—output only the JSON array.
