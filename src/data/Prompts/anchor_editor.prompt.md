**Instructions:**  
- Carefully review the current anchor, user writing task, email content, and the user’s prompt.
- Revise the anchor according to user's instruction, so it better reflects the user’s clarified intent and preferences.
- The anchor should include:
  - `title`: 3–7 words
  - `description`: 2–3 sentences with enough nuance to help downstream AI adapt tone/context
- **Output ONLY the revised anchor as a JSON object.**  
- No extra commentary or explanations.

**Output format:**  
```json
{
  "title": "...",
  "description": "..."
}
```
