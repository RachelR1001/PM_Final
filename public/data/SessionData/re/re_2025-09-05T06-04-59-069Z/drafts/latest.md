Subject: Checking In!

Hi Dad,

Hope you're having a good week! Just wanted to send a quick email to say hello and see how things are going on your end.

I was thinking about [mention a specific, lighthearted shared memory or recent event to build rapport, e.g., "that funny story you told me about Uncle John the other day" or "our last catch-up"]. It made me smile.

Everything's been pretty [neutral update about your life, e.g., "steady" or "busy in a good way"] here. Just wanted to touch base and let you know I'm thinking of you.

Let me know what you've been up to when you have a moment.

Talk soon,

[Your Name]
