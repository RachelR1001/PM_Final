You are an expert assistant for abstracting email context.

**Writing task:**  
{{ORIGINAL_TASK}}

**Current email draft:**  
{{DRAFT_LATEST}}

**Intent value pairs:**  
{{INTENT_CURRENT}}

---

**Instructions:**  
- Carefully analyze the provided draft email and the user’s intent pairs.
- Build two concise, reusable anchors for this communication:
  - **Persona anchor:** How do you describe the Persona of a certain group of people who the user is communicating with and will be communicating to in the future? The Persona should not be too specific, but not too broad either.
  - **Situation anchor:** How do you describe the Situation in which the user is communicating? The Situation should not be too specific, but not too broad either.
- Each anchor should include a `title` (3–7 words) and a `description` (2–3 sentences with enough detail to help AI writers adapt tone and context in future emails).
- **Output ONLY the following JSON object, nothing else:**  

```json
{
  "persona": {
    "title": "...",
    "description": "..."
  },
  "situation": {
    "title": "...",
    "description": "..."
  }
}
